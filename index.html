						<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/main.jpg" alt="" /></a>

						<p>I've been always curious about everything and all about problem-solving. 
							I can't count how many broken objects I disassembled to understand how 
							they worked and try to fix them myself as a kid. After getting a Bachelor of
							 Science in Mechanical Engineering from University of Texas at Austin in 2015, I 
							 worked in manufacturing industry. <br>While working in the field, I encountered
							  a problem for which conventional solutions were inadequate, but maching learning 
							  approach was very promising. Since then, I pursued self-teaching data science and 
							  machine learning while doing personal projects and competing in Kaggle where I 
							  placed in top 2% and 9% in two competitions. Over time, I fell in love with data 
							  science and also realized limitations in resources to apply data science skills with 
							  the position I held at the time. Eventually, I decided to fully pivot into data science 
							  and I would like to share some of my end-to-end projects I completed in Portfolio section below.

											<h3>In this project, I trained LSTM models to generate melody and percussion, 
												which are then combined to generate EDM music with sprinkles of Classical music. 
												Then, neural network classifier was built to gauge output from LSTM models. 
												Finally, interactive Flask app was built to utilize pretrained models to easily 
												generate and play songs.

										<header>
											<h3>I built a tree based classifier LightGBM to classify a person's emotion based 
												on his/her actual voice. I used LightGBM instead of neural network architecture 
												such as CNN with RNN or LSTM since non-NN models are generally quicker than NN 
												at training and predicting, and are more fit for implementation in real world 
												applications. However, a lot of manual feature engineering was necessary to achieve 
												meaningful results since non-NN models don't have automatic feature engineering 
												from filters in CNN architecture.

											<h3>I applied natural language processing (NLP) on news articles to perform topic 
												modeling using bag-of-words approach and sentiment analysis using open source 
												modules. Topic modeling gives a very concise visual for the user to understand 
												topics and trends revolving around Bitcoin and cryptocurrency over time. Also, 
												features created from sentiment analysis were combined with other features 
												(Bitcoin's open price, close price, volume, etc.) to build a LSTM model to predict 
												Bitcoin price.

											<h3>I built a linear regression model (ElasticNet) to predict Chicago's daily 
												crime rate by web scraping 10 years worth of various weather data. Then I 
												added more data (total ridership and unemployment rate) on top of performing 
												feature engineering.
